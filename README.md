# Flask to Airtable on Pythonanywhere
This simple code demonstration provides a quick starting point for making use of the Airtable API, jQuery dataTable and C3 in Python Flask for web publishing.

There are still many limitations in accessing related tables and more complicated data structures in Airtable json data. Hopefully this repo will be updated as new tricks gradually get revealed in my discoveries. Please make sure you change the App ID, API key, table name and field names to suit your own needs.
