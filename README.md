# Flask to Airtable
This simple code demonstration provides a quick starting point for making use of the Airtable API, jQuery dataTable and C3 in Python Flask for web publishing.
##
There are limitations in hosting Flask application on Pythonanywhere using the free account. Thus, I've moved the sample application on a privately hosted server. Please make sure you change the App ID, API key, table name and field names to suit your own needs.
